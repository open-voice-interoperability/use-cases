# use-cases
This repository contains use cases for interoperability among intelligent conversational assistants.

Some general categories of use cases include examples where a user is trying to perform related tasks that would normally require visiting multiple unrelated websites or chatbots. For example:
1. End-user use cases: An individual is trying to perform multiple related tasks that involve several different types of expertise, and that might need to draw on the knowledge of different intelligent assistants. Just a few examples could be travel planning (which might also involve the government if a passport is needed), home renovations, sending a student to college, selling or buying a house, or planning a family reunion.
2. Organization use cases: Similarly, an employee of an organization is trying to perform an HR task that involves different types of expertise. For example, the employee has a new baby and wants to modify their tax withholding, add the baby to their health insurance, change beneficiaries on accounts, and arrange for parental leave. Without interoperability, this could force the user to visit four different websites or assistants, probably reentering the same information several times.

These are just a few examples -- we're looking for contributions from the community to add to these ideas. You can describe your use case in any format and send a pull request to add it to this repository.
